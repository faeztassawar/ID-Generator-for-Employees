# ID-Generator-for-Employees
This Python project is a CSV-based Employee ID Generator. It reads employee data from an input CSV file, generates unique IDs based on their hired position and a random number, and writes the updated data into an output CSV file. Additionally, the program provides an option to display the generated IDs in the terminal.
